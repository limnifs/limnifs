## 2026-07-29 — Phase 0 Track A first prose (session 2)

### Done (with evidence)

- **Spec v0.1 outline merged via rebase-merge** —
  [limnifs/spec#2](https://github.com/limnifs/spec/pull/2). Before merge,
  fixed two outline issues as a NEW commit on the PR branch (not amended
  — see Decisions):
  - Added "Metadata reference" as manifest §5 item 3 (the Merkle root
    formula in `02-algorithms.md §3` commits to `H(metadata)`, so the
    manifest must carry a section recording it).
  - Made the Merkle root formula explicit
    (`H(metadata) || H(section_1) || … || H(section_9)`) and fixed a
    wrong cross-reference in §1 (was `(§5.8)` pointing to History;
    corrected to point at the Merkle root construction).
- **Spec v0.1 Part I prose merged via rebase-merge** —
  [limnifs/spec#3](https://github.com/limnifs/spec/pull/3). §1
  Foundational invariants (identity rule, image identity, representation
  plane separation, determinism) and §2 Terminology (limnologic
  vocabulary + semantic type widths) now have full normative prose.
- **SPEC.md main**: 561 lines (was 418). Three commits in linear history
  on `limnifs/spec/main`.

### Decisions resolved in v0.1 (recorded in spec §20)

- **Solid-block boundaries**: per-slab solid windows with explicit
  boundaries; cross-slab class groups deferred to a `solid-blocks-v2`
  feature flag.
- **Rename semantics**: no first-class `Rename` op in v0.1; the delta
  builder compiles detected renames to `Remove+Add`. First-class rename
  deferred to a `rename-ops` feature flag.

### Deferred to other components (spec §21)

- FastCDC parameters and minimum drop size → `04-writer-pipeline`.
- Time-lock puzzle calibration → `05-crypto` (v1 ships Shamir-only).

### Next

- Part II prose (§3–5: drop store, metadata, manifest — the three layers).
- Part III prose (§6–8: addressing, overlays, derivation operations).
- Parts IV–VIII prose (§9–22: registries, crypto/EC references,
  versioning, conformance, worked examples).
- Then in parallel: [01-flatbuffers-schema] (consumes §3, §4, §5 wire
  details) and [01-feature-flag-registry] (consumes §9–14).

### Decisions (session 2)

- **Merge strategy switched**: rebase-merge for green PRs (was squash
  in session 1). Reason: "retain best code only" — rebase preserves
  every commit's content on `main`; squash collapses them.
- **Outline polish before merge**: pre-merge fixes land as NEW commits
  on the PR branch, not amend. The PR diff shows the cleanup explicitly
  so reviewers can see the before/after.

### In progress / Blockers

- Nothing mid-flight. No blockers.

## 2026-07-29 — Day 0 setup (session 1)

### Done (with evidence)

- **5 org repos created** (all public):
  [limnifs/limnifs](https://github.com/limnifs/limnifs),
  [limnifs/spec](https://github.com/limnifs/spec),
  [limnifs/limnifs-py](https://github.com/limnifs/limnifs-py),
  [limnifs/limnifs-frozen2](https://github.com/limnifs/limnifs-frozen2),
  [limnifs/.github](https://github.com/limnifs/.github).
- **Each repo bootstrapped** with its first commit on `main` (the only
  main-push override granted for the campaign). Local clone layout:
  `~/src/limnifs/{repo}`.
- **`13-actions-matrix` complete** —
  [task file](13-ci-releases/13-actions-matrix.md) marked `done` with both
  halves of the acceptance evidence linked:
  - Green (empty skeleton): [limnifs/.github#1](https://github.com/limnifs/.github/pull/1) —
    run https://github.com/limnifs/.github/actions/runs/30426996117
  - Red (mutant `todo!()`): [limnifs/limnifs#2](https://github.com/limnifs/limnifs/pull/2)
    (closed unmerged) — run https://github.com/limnifs/limnifs/actions/runs/30432668400
- **Per-repo CI callers wired** — PRs
  [limnifs/limnifs#1](https://github.com/limnifs/limnifs/pull/1),
  [limnifs/spec#1](https://github.com/limnifs/spec/pull/1),
  [limnifs/limnifs-py#1](https://github.com/limnifs/limnifs-py/pull/1),
  [limnifs/limnifs-frozen2#1](https://github.com/limnifs/limnifs-frozen2/pull/1),
  all merged green; every product repo's `main` now runs the matrix on push
  and on PR.

### In progress

- Nothing mid-flight.

### Next

- Phase 0 Track A: `01-spec` — draft spec v0.1 in `limnifs/spec`, then
  FlatBuffers schema, then feature-flag registry. See
  [01-spec/README.md](01-spec/README.md) and the task files within.

### Blockers

- None. User delegation in effect for this campaign: green PRs may be merged
  by the agent via `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch`. No tags, no
  main-push, no red merges.

### Decisions

- Local clone layout: `~/src/limnifs/{repo}` (first level matches GitHub org
  name) — user-directed.
- Day-0 first commit on `main` per repo is the only main-push exception; all
  subsequent work goes through PRs.
- Action SHAs currently pinned to major-version tags (`@v4`, `@v5`);
  SHA pinning is a tracked follow-up in `13-actions-matrix.md`.
